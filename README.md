# lMultiplayLevelTest
Streaming level multiplayer demo

Found What I think is a bug in Unreal Engine 5.1 where creating instances of streaming levels where it'll kick any client players out of the level. The problem is only in Ureal 5.1 play in editor mode, stand alone mode and previous version of Unreal don't have the problem.

Reported to EPIC for them to look at.
